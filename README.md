## Hello there! Welcome to my GitHub' Profile! It's a pleasure to have you here. ðŸ‘‹

### â€¢ About me:

#### - My name is Antonio Lucas, and I'm a continuous student on this vast world of programming. Currently, I'm taking a degree on Computer Science at USP. As a side work, I make tutorials about Competitive Programming on Neps Academy, a Brazilian Site that helps others learn about Competitive Programming. Basically, I'm discovering more and more about myself with programming, so I hope that I forever continue to explore and study Programming!
