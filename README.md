# Hello there! Welcome to my GitHub' Profile! It's a pleasure to have you here. ðŸ‘‹

### â€¢ About me:

  My name is Antonio Lucas, I'm from Brazil and I'm 17 years old. I'm a continuous student on this vast world of programming. Currently, I'm taking a degree on Computer Science at Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo. Sometimes, I like to make tutorials about Competitive Programming on Neps Academy, a Brazilian Site that helps others learn about Competitive Programming. Basically, I'm discovering more and more about myself with programming, so I hope that I forever continue to explore and study Programming!

### â€¢ What am I doing right now?

* I'm taking classes at different courses, especialty those provided by the University that I study.
* I'm learning more and more about a lot of things of programming, exploring the concepts of Competitive Programming, Desktop Development, Web Development, and so on.
* I love to test my knowledge with challenges, like those presented on <a href="https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/judge/pt/profile/413194">URI</a> or <a href = "https://neps.academy/br/user/6155">Neps Academy</a>.
* I try to be the best version of myself everyday!
